## Disclaimer

Before using the Block Party Extension, please be aware that automating interactions on websites, including blocking users, might violate the terms of service of some platforms. We encourage you to review the terms of service of any website you use with this extension. The developers of Block Party are not responsible for any consequences that arise from such violations.

## Usage

### Creating and Managing Blocklists
1. **Importing Blocklists:** Users can start by importing pre-existing blocklists available in simple JSON format. This can be done via the import feature in the extension's options page. Default blocklists can be found in the `./lists` directory.

2. **Creating Blocklists:** Users can also create their own blocklists by adding websites and specifying usernames they wish to block.

1. **Navigating Blocklists:** When visiting a supported site, only blocklists relevant to that site are shown, enhancing usability and focus. On non-supported sites, all blocklists are visible but the block functionality is hidden.

Block Party currently supports:
- [x] TikTok
- [ ] Instagram
- [ ] Facebook
- [x] Twitter
- [ ] YouTube


When you are on one of these supported sites, the 'Block Users' button appears, enabling you to begin the automatic blocking process. Simply activate it and the extension handles the restâ€”systematically blocking users according to your blocklist. Relax and observe as it seamlessly cleans up your online space.

</br>Have a particularly long list? Don't worry, you can halt the automation anytime by simply closing the tab. You can resume the blocking process whenever you choose. Keep track of your progress directly through the extension popup, where you can see overall or blocklist-specific progress.

### Sharing and Exporting Blocklists
Blocklists can be easily shared with others by exporting them into JSON files, fostering a community-based approach to content management.
